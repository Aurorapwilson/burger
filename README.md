# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

In this assignment I created a burger logger utilizing MySQL, NODE.js, Express, API routing, and Express Handlebars. 
The criteria for this assignment were to create, update, and delete data from the database using the frontend, which was created using handlebars to render the front end. 

* The app had to be deployed through Heroku

###About

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](https://youtu.be/msvdn95x9OM).

* Currently this app only displays the Json model to the browser.
